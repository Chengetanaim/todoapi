# Todo API

This was my first time ever creating a project using Django Rest framework. 
I created a simple todo application using API's.
Other developers can perform GET, POST and PUT requests on the todo's.

## What I learnt:

- creating API's in Django Rest framework
- working with the Swagger UI in Django for docummenting my API
